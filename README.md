Assignment V:
Top Places
===========
Objective
----------
In this assignment, you will create an application that presents a list of popular Flickr
photo spots and then allow the user to see some photos taken in those spots.

The primary work to be done in this assignment is to create a tab-based user-interface
with two tabs: Top Places and Recents. The first tab will allow the user to view which
places on Earth have been the most popular for taking photos posted to Flickr and then
look at some photos from those places. The second tab will let the user go back and see
his or her most recently-viewed (inside your application) photos.

The goals are to get familiar with table views, scroll view, image view and
multithreading and to learn how to build a Universal application that runs on both
iPhone and iPad (with appropriate UIs on each).

All the data you need will be downloaded from Flickr.com using Flickrâ€™s API. Code will
be provided which can build URLs for the Flickr queries you need for this assignment.
